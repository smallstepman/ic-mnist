            // Security: The Content Security Policy (CSP) given below aims at working with many apps rather than providing maximal security.
            // We recommend tightening the CSP for your specific application. Some recommendations are as follows:
            // - Use the CSP Evaluator (https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) to validate the CSP you define.
            // - Follow the “Strict CSP” recommendations (https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). However, note that in the context of the IC,
            //   nonces cannot be used because the response bodies must be static to work well with HTTP asset certification.
            //   Thus, we recommend to include script hashes (in combination with strict-dynamic) in the CSP as described
            //   in https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/faq.html in section “What if my site is static and I can't add nonces to scripts?”.
            //   See for example the II CSP (https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/src/internet_identity/src/http.rs).
            // - It is recommended to tighten the connect-src directive. With the current CSP configuration the browser can
            //   make requests to https://*.icp0.io, hence being able to call any canister via https://icp0.io/api/v2/canister/{canister-ID}.
            //   This could potentially be used in combination with another vulnerability (e.g. XSS) to exfiltrate private data.
            //   The developer can configure this policy to only allow requests to their specific canisters,
            //   e.g: connect-src 'self' https://icp-api.io/api/v2/canister/{my-canister-ID}, where {my-canister-ID} has the following format: aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaa
            // - It is recommended to configure style-src, style-src-elem and font-src directives with the resources your canister is going to use
            //   instead of using the wild card (*) option. Normally this will include 'self' but also other third party styles or fonts resources (e.g: https://fonts.googleapis.com or other CDNs)

        },
        // redirect all requests from .raw.icp0.io to .icp0.io (this redirection is the default)
        "allow_raw_access": false
